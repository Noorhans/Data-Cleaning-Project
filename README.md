🗂️ Real-Time Global Layoffs — MySQL Data Cleaning & Structuring

This project presents a clean and structured dataset built from **real-time global layoff data**, fully managed within **MySQL**. The focus was on organizing raw layoff reports into a reliable and queryable format for further analysis, reporting, or visualization.
🛠️ Highlights:
- Raw Data Ingestion: Imported dynamic data tracking workforce changes across companies and regions
- MySQL-Based Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled nulls, and standardized schema entirely within SQL
- Scalable & Reusable Structure: Designed normalized tables and views for efficient querying
- Ready for Exploration: Prepped for integration into BI tools or future analytical workflows
🚀 Why It Matters:
Global layoff data offers critical insight into economic shifts and employment trends. This project aims to make that data trustworthy and usable for journalists, researchers, and business analysts alike, without relying on complex data pipelines.
